# AI Puzzle Solver - DFS vs A*

## Description
This project is an implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and A\* algorithms for solving puzzles. The DFS and A\* algorithms are used to find the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point on the puzzle.

## Features
* Implementation of the DFS and A\* algorithms for solving puzzles
* Generation of random puzzles with adjustable size
* Display of the shortest path found by the DFS and A\* algorithms
* Comparison of the execution time between the DFS and A\* algorithms

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Pygame

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local directory
2. Install Pygame by running the command `pip install pygame` in the terminal
3. Run the `main.py` file by running the command `python main.py` in the terminal
4. Wait for the puzzle to be generated and the DFS and A\* algorithms to solve it
